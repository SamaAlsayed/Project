Qatar Sustainable Products App

Overview

The Qatar Sustainable Products App is a web application developed to promote local products as substitutes for foreign products in three main categories: dairies, beverages, and snacks. The app aims to align with Qatar's National Development Strategy, specifically focusing on the goal of Sustainable Economic Growth.

Goals

Promote Local Products: The app aims to raise awareness about locally produced goods and encourage consumers to choose them over imported products.

Support Economic Growth: By promoting local products, the app contributes to the growth of local industries and reduces reliance on imports, thus strengthening the economy.

Environmental Impact: Choosing local products over imported ones can reduce the carbon footprint associated with transportation and support sustainable practices in local production.

Project Proposal

Goal Alignment: The app aligns with Qatar's National Development Strategy goal of Sustainable Economic Growth by promoting the consumption of local products. This supports the development of specialized economic clusters and contributes to the goal of achieving significant improvements in labor productivity and foreign direct investment.

Societal Impact: The app aims to raise awareness about the availability and benefits of local products, supporting local producers and enhancing food security in Qatar. By encouraging the consumption of local products, the app contributes to the sustainability of the local economy and reduces reliance on imports.
Features

Product Listings: Display a list of local products in the categories of dairies, beverages, and snacks, along with their foreign counterparts and information about where to find them.

Search Functionality: Allow users to search for specific products or browse through the categories to find suitable replacements for foreign products.

Detailed Information: Provide detailed information about each product, including its origin, nutritional value, and any certifications it may have.

User Interaction: Implement a user-friendly interface using React to ensure smooth navigation and an engaging user experience.

Implementation Details

Frontend: The app will be built using React to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Backend: No backend is required as the app will fetch data from a static database or API containing information about local products.

Data Management: Local product information will be managed in a structured format (e.g., JSON) and loaded dynamically into the app.

Deployment: The app will be deployed to a hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) for public access.
