Qatar Sustainable Products App

Overview

The Qatar Sustainable Products App is a web application developed to promote local products as substitutes for foreign products in three main categories: dairies, beverages, and snacks. The app aims to align with Qatar's National Development Strategy, specifically focusing on the goal of Sustainable Economic Growth.

Goals

Promote Local Products: The app aims to raise awareness about locally produced goods and encourage consumers to choose them over imported products.

Support Economic Growth: By promoting local products, the app contributes to the growth of local industries and reduces reliance on imports, thus strengthening the economy.

Environmental Impact: 

Choosing local products over imported ones can reduce the carbon footprint associated with transportation and support sustainable practices in local production.

Features

Product Listings: Display a list of local products in the categories of dairies, beverages, and snacks, along with their foreign counterparts and information about where to find them.

Search Functionality: Allow users to search for specific products or browse through the categories to find suitable replacements for foreign products.

Detailed Information: Provide detailed information about each product, including its origin, nutritional value, and any certifications it may have.

User Interaction: Implement a user-friendly interface using React to ensure smooth navigation and an engaging user experience.

Implementation Details

Frontend: The app will be built using React to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Backend: No backend is required as the app will fetch data from a static database or API containing information about local products.

Data Management: Local product information will be managed in a structured format (e.g., JSON) and loaded dynamically into the app.

Deployment: The app will be deployed to a hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) for public access.

Development Process

Planning: Define the app's features, user interface, and data structure.

Design: Create mockups and wireframes to visualize the app's layout and user flow.

Implementation: Develop the frontend using React and integrate with a static database or API for product information.

Testing: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the app functions as expected and is user-friendly.

Deployment: Deploy the app to a hosting service for public access.
